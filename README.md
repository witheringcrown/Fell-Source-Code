# Fell Source Code
Fell is a precision platformer game I made from scratch using the GameMaker Studio 2 game engine. It uses its own programming language called GameMaker Language or GML. The syntax is similar to that of C#, but it's more forgiving.

I learned a lot from this project as it is one of the largest I've worked on. The game is fully featured from beginning to end.
Highlighted Mechanics and Features:
- the game features fully functional frontend menus that update backend settings and display information related to backend settings.
- a settings menu that allows players to tailor their user expeirence. Settings include volume, fullscreen, fully customizable keybinds, and more.
- an auto-tiling system that allows tilesets to dynamically populate levels at runtime.
- a pallette system that programmatically changes the color of tiles and backgrounds at runtime.
- responsive platformer movement including acceleration and coyote time.
- a simple dialogue system that displays images to simulate speaking and give instructions.
- polished game feel mechanics like particle effects and scene transitions.
- a made-from-scratch input system that seamlessly transitions between keyboard and controller.
